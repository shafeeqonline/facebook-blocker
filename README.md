# facebook-blocker

Chrome extension that blocks posts having keywords that you provide

### Description

Our facebook feeds are usually bloated with unncessary posts that we want to ignore. 
For instance: Wannabe fans of a popular music bands will start posting images of stars they never follow. And about 20 people will keep adding the same picture again and again. You could now block it by just adding keywords and this extension will hide it.
